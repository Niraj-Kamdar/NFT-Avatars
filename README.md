Customizable NFT Avatars

## Intro

## Description
I wanted to create a customizable NFT that can be used as a profile in games or social networking dapp. I am currently developing a game called cryptomafias and thought that it would be a nice addition to it. I am using ERC1155 standard for this. Each avatar is an NFT which will be different from one another while there are also attachments like hat, longHair, etc. which aren't limited. You can attach and remove attachments easily from your avatar. I am using subgraph to keep track of current avatar configuration. It isn't perfect and can be improved significantly. Once completed it can be used with many dapp where people can use these Avatars to represent themselves online.

## Closing notes
This project is just a prototype of how can we implement customizable avatar NFT using existing APIs. I have kept buying Avatar and Attachmnet free for testing purpose but It can be possible to add an incentive layer. It can also be possible to create a frontend SDK that devs can use to integrate this in their dapp.
